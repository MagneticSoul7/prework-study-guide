# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to build this online study guide to help myself remember some of the fundamental basics of web development and Git before I start attending ASU's fullstack web-development bootcamp. This online study guide will be a place that I can refer back to quickly and easily throughout my studies in the bootcamp in case I forget one of the Git commands or in case I need to refresh my memory on some of the differences between HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I can continue to add more notes to it whenever I want, and maybe it might help other beginners who are trying to learn web-development as well.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section (HTML, CSS, Git, or Javascript). Or if you prefer to choose which topic to study at random, open the study guide website in Google Chrome, then open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). Or another way to open the Chrome DevTools is to right click on the study guide webpage and choose "inspect" at the very bottom of the menu. Once you have opened the Chrome DevTools (which should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser), you'll want to switch to the "Console" tab instead of the "Elements" tab. There in the Console tab, you will see the list of four topics to study, along with a computer-randomized suggestion of what to study first. And then, each time that you want a new randomized suggestion of what to study next, you can simply press the refresh button located next to your browser's URL.

Happy Studying!
